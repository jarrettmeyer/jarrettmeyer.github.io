      <p>
        This visualization shows the <strong>total daily supply of calories per capita</strong> by country from 1961 to 2022. The data represents the average daily caloric intake available to each person in a country, which is an important indicator of food security and nutritional well-being.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2">Key Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Global Trends:</strong> Most countries have experienced increases in caloric supply over the past 60+ years due to improvements in agricultural productivity and food distribution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regional Variation:</strong> Developed nations tend to have higher caloric supplies, while some developing nations have lower values.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dietary Changes:</strong> Over time, patterns may reflect economic development, industrialization of agriculture, and dietary transitions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Food Security Indicator:</strong> Caloric supply is one metric used to assess food security, though it doesn't account for food quality, nutritional diversity, or distribution within countries.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2">Data Source</h3>
      <p>
        This data comes from the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/global-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our World in Data Global Food Explorer</a>, which aggregates data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2">Understanding the Metrics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Daily Caloric Supply:</strong> The average amount of food (expressed in calories) available for consumption per person per day. This is calculated as food production plus imports minus exports and non-food uses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Per Capita:</strong> Divided by the population, so it represents an average per person (not everyone consumes exactly this amount).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recommended Intake:</strong> The typical adult needs approximately 2,000-2,500 calories per day, though this varies by age, sex, and activity level.
        </li>
      </ul>
