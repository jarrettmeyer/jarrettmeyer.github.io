Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

**Example 1**:

```text
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

**Example 2**:

```text
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

## First Solution

My first solution was brute force. Start with index 0. Check if all strings have the same character at that index. If they do, add the character to the prefix and move to the next index. Repeat until either the characters do not match or an IndexError is raised (shortest word).

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        prefix = ""

        def all_matching(i: int) -> bool:
            for j in range(1, len(strs)):
                if strs[j][i] != strs[0][i]:
                    return ""
            return strs[0][i]

        i = 0
        while i >= 0:
            try:
                char = all_matching(i)

                if char != "":
                    prefix += char
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            except IndexError:
                break

        return prefix
```

## Second Solution

For my second solution, I used Python's built-in `zip` function to group characters from each string by index. Then I used a regular expression to check that all characters in each group are the same. If they are, I add the character to the prefix. If not, I break the loop.

```python
import re

class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        prefix = ""

        for t in zip(*strs):
            s = "".join(t)
            if re.match(r"^(.)\1*$", s):
                prefix += s[0]
            else:
                break

        return prefix
```
