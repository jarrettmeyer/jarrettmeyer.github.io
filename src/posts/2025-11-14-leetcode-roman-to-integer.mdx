Convert a [Roman numeral to an integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/). Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

## First Approach

My first approach was to iterate through the string, checking both the current character and previous character. For example, `MCM` = 1900.

1. Initialize result to 0.
2. Character 1 = `M`. Add 1000. Result = 1000.
3. Character 2 = `C`. Add 100. Result = 1100.
4. Character 3 = `M`. Previous character is `C`, Add 800. Result = 1900.

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        value = 0
        prev_char = None

        for idx in range(len(s)):
            char = s[idx]

            if char == "M" and prev_char == "C":
                value += 800
            elif char == "D" and prev_char == "C":
                value += 300
            elif char == "C" and prev_char == "X":
                value += 80
            elif char == "L" and prev_char == "X":
                value += 30
            elif char == "X" and prev_char == "I":
                value += 8
            elif char == "V" and prev_char == "I":
                value += 3
            elif char == "M":
                value += 1000
            elif char == "D":
                value += 500
            elif char == "C":
                value += 100
            elif char == "L":
                value += 50
            elif char == "X":
                value += 10
            elif char == "V":
                value += 5
            elif char == "I":
                value += 1

            prev_char = char

        return value
```

## Second Approach

<LeetCodeResult runtime="3" beats="79.99" />

```python
cclass Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        char_map = {
            "CM": 900,
            "CD": 400,
            "XC": 90,
            "XL": 40,
            "IX": 9,
            "IV": 4,
            "M": 1000,
            "D": 500,
            "C": 100,
            "L": 50,
            "X": 10,
            "V": 5,
            "I": 1,
        }

        result = 0

        idx = 0
        while idx < len(s):
            # Check for two characters
            if idx < len(s) - 1 and s[idx:idx + 2] in char_map:
                result += char_map[s[idx:idx + 2]]
                idx += 2
                continue

            # Otherwise, one character
            result += char_map[s[idx]]
            idx += 1

        return result

```
