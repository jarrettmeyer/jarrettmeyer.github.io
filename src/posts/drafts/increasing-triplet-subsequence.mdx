## Solution

The constraints state that the maximum value is `2^31 - 1`. This is used as the initial values for `first` and `second`.

Loop through each `val` in `nums`.

- If `val` is equal to `first` or `second`, do nothing.
- If `val` is less than `first`, update `first` to be `val`.
- If `val` is less than `second`, update `second` to be `val`. This means that `second` is guaranteed to be strictly greater than `first`.
- Otherwise, return `True`. This guarantees that `val` is greater than both `first` and `second`.

```python
class Solution:
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        first = 2 ** 31 - 1
        second = 2 ** 31 - 1

        for val in nums:
            if val == first or val == second:
                pass
            elif val < first:
                first = val
            elif val < second:
                second = val
            else:
                return True

        return False
```
