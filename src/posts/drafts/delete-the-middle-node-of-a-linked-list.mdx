## Solution

Track two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. Move `fast` two nodes for every one node that `slow` moves. When `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` will be at the node before the middle node.

![Algorithm example](/images/posts/leetcode/delete-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list/example-1.png)

You will notice that `slow` is one node ahead. Let's introduce `prev` to keep track of the node before `slow`.

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head is None or head.next is None:
            return None

        slow = head
        fast = head
        prev = None

        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            prev = slow
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        if prev and prev.next:
          prev.next = prev.next.next

        return head
```
