## Solution

Three-pointer technique with `previous`, `current`, and `next`.

While `current` is not `None`:

- Store `current.next` in `next`.
- Set `current.next` to `previous`.
- Move `previous` to `current`.
- Move `current` to `next`.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        previous, current = None, head

        while current:
            next = current.next
            current.next = previous
            previous, current = current, next

        return previous
```
