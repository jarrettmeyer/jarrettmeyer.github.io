## Solution

Create a pointer `i` for walking through `s`.

Walk through each character `c` in `t`. If `c` matches `s[i]`, increment `i` by 1. If we have reached the end of `s`, then a subsequence is found.

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) == 0:
            return True

        s_index = 0

        for c in t:
            if s[s_index] == c:
                s_index += 1
                if s_index >= len(s):
                    return True

        return False
```
