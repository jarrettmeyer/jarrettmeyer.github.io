Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring that contains no repeating characters.

## Solution

Initialize the list of unique characters - `chars` - to an empty list. Iterate over every character `char` in `s`.

If `char` is already in `chars`, remove all characters up to and including the first occurrence of `char` from `chars`.

Example:
- `chars = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]` and `char = "b"`. The index of `"b"` is 1. `chars = chars[2:] = ["c", "d"]`.
- `chars = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]` and `char = "d"`. The index of `"d"` is 3. `chars = chars[4:] = []`, then after appending `"d"` in the next step, `chars = ["d"]`. We take advantage of how indices work with Python slicing.

Append `char` to the end of `chars`.

Return the longest `chars` seen.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        best = 0
        chars = []
        for char in s:
            if char in chars:
                chars = chars[chars.index(char) + 1:]

            chars.append(char)

            if len(chars) > best:
                best = len(chars)

        return best
```
