/>

## Solution

Track two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. Move `fast` two nodes for every one node that `slow` moves. When `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` will be at the node before the middle node.

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head is None or head.next is None:
            return None

        slow = ListNode(None)
        slow.next = head
        fast = head

        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
```
