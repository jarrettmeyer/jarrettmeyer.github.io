## Solution

We don't actualy need to perform the swap operations. Instead we can can count the number of groups of zeros as we iterate backwards through the binary string.

<LeetCodeResult runtime={63} beats={56.68} />

```python
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, s: str) -> int:
        zero_groups = 0
        total = 0
        n = len(s)

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == "0":
                if i == n - 1 or s[i + 1] == "1":
                    zero_groups += 1
            else:
                total += zero_groups

        return total
```
