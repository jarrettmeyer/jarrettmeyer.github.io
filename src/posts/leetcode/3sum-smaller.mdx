## Solution

For this problem, we can use two dictionaries to keep track of counts. The first dictionary will track values we've seen so far. The second dictionary will track sums of pairs of values we've seen so far.

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumSmaller(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        answer = 0

        value_counter = {}
        sum_pairs_counter = {}

        for value in nums:
            for key in sum_pairs_counter:
                if (value + key) < target:
                    answer += sum_pairs_counter[key]

            for key in value_counter:
                if (value + key) in sum_pairs_counter:
                    sum_pairs_counter[value + key] += value_counter[key]
                else:
                    sum_pairs_counter[value + key] = value_counter[key]

            if value in value_counter:
                value_counter[value] += 1
            else:
                value_counter[value] = 1

        return answer
```

### Notes

- You can use Python's `collections.Counter` to simplify counting. This had slightly worse performance in my testing.
- This solution has a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>). The worst case scenario is that all values are unique, requiring us to consider every possible pair of values for each `value` in `nums`.
