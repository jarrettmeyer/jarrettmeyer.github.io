## Solution

Calculate the sum of the first `k` elements.

Use a sliding window approach to iterate through the array starting from index `k`. For each new element added to the window, subtract the element that is leaving the window (i.e., the element at index `i - k`). Update the current sum and check if it's greater than the greatest sum found so far.

Return the greatest sum divided by `k` to get the maximum average.

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        current_sum = 0
        for i in range(k):
            current_sum += nums[i]

        greatest_sum = current_sum

        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            current_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
            if current_sum > greatest_sum:
                greatest_sum = current_sum

        return greatest_sum / k
```
