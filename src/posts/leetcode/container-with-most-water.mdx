## Solution

This is another two-pointer problem. One pointer starts from the first element; the other starts from the last element.

The area is the distance between the two pointers multiplied by the shorter of the two heights. We keep track of the best area found so far.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        best_area = -1
        while left < right:
            shortest = min(height[left], height[right])
            area = (right - left) * shortest
            if area > best_area:
                best_area = area

            if height[left] == shortest:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

        return best_area
```
