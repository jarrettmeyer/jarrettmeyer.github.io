This is my first **hard** rated LeetCode problem, and I solved it in 0ms!

- Find the total length of both arrays.
- Determine if the total length is even or odd. This will affect how we calculate the median.
- Use two pointers to traverse both arrays simultaneously.
- Keep track of the current and previous elements. We will need the previous element if the total length is even.
- If `i` has reached the end of `nums1`, we must take the next element from `nums2`.
- If `j` has reached the end of `nums2`, we must take the next element from `nums1`.
- If the current element in `nums1` is less than or equal to the current element in `nums2`, we take the element from `nums1`.
- Otherwise, we take the element from `nums2`.
- Stop when we have traversed half of the total elements.

```python
class Solution:
    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float:
        n = len(nums1) + len(nums2)
        even = n % 2 == 0
        stop = n // 2
        
        i = 0
        j = 0
        prev = None
        curr = None

        while i < len(nums1) or j < len(nums2):
            if curr is not None:
                prev = curr

            if i == len(nums1):
                curr = nums2[j]
                j += 1
            elif j == len(nums2):
                curr = nums1[i]
                i += 1
            elif nums1[i] <= nums2[j]:
                curr = nums1[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                curr = nums2[j]
                j += 1

            if i + j > stop:
                break

        if even:
            return (prev + curr) / 2

        return curr

```
