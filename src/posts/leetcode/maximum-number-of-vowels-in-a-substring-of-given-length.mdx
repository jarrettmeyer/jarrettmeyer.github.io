<Alert type="info">This problem is nearly identical to <a href="/posts/leetcode/maximum-average-subarray-i/">Maximum Average Subarray I</a>, but instead of calculating averages, we are counting vowels in substrings.</Alert>

## Solution

Calculate the number of vowels in the first `k` elements.

Use a sliding window approach to iterate through the array starting from index `k`. For each new element added to the window, add to the vowel count if the `i`-th element is a vowel, and subtract from the vowel count if the `i - k`-th element is a vowel. Update the maximum vowel count found so far.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        vowels = {"a", "e", "i", "o", "u"}

        count_vowels = 0

        for i in range(k):
            if s[i] in vowels:
                count_vowels += 1

        max_vowels = count_vowels

        for i in range(k, len(s)):
            if s[i] in vowels:
                count_vowels += 1
            if s[i - k] in vowels:
                count_vowels -= 1
            if count_vowels > max_vowels:
                max_vowels = count_vowels

        return max_vowels
```
